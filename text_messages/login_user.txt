Hello {},

Welcome aboard !

In this round you will have the Cicadian butterfly, with 10 missions pinned on its body. Each of these 10 nodes is a key to find the antidote. On solving one node, it turns green, and gets you a step closer to your treasure. Finally, on completing all 10 questions, all the nodes will interconnect, the Cicada will heal and it will lead you to ARCANE, the secret and mysterious antidote.

To help you to your quest, hints will be released shortly after the beginning of Round-2 on our socials.

Whatâ€™s stopping you? See you in the leaderboards!

With Regards 
IEEE SB NITD
